## Welcome
👋 Hello! I am a Computer Science student with a keen interest in Data Science, Machine Learning, and business process optimization.

👨‍💼 Currently, I work as an Administrative Assistant I at Grupo Energisa in the Mato Grosso do Sul unit, where I am part of the Large Clients and Public Sector Coordination team. My main responsibilities include developing process automations and improvements through RPA (Robotic Process Automation) and conducting data analyses to support strategic decision-making. Additionally, I develop support tools for managers and coordinators, enabling more efficient management and detailed process monitoring.

🔧 I utilize tools such as Python, Power BI, Excel, and SQL to create solutions that add value to the business, enhance operational efficiency, and generate strategic insights.

📈 I am currently advancing my skills in BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) and exploring the Bizagi software for process modeling. Furthermore, I am deepening my knowledge in Data Science and Machine Learning to broaden my capabilities in developing data-driven and analytical solutions.

📚 My goal is to build expertise in these areas to contribute innovations that enhance decision-making and optimize business processes, always focused on adding value and driving progress in the market.

Let’s connect and explore new collaboration opportunities!
