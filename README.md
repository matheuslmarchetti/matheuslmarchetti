## Welcome

I'm Matheus L. Marchetti, a Computer Science student passionate about the energy sector and dedicated to leveraging technology to enhance processes.

👨‍💼 Currently, I work as an Administrative Assistant I at Grupo Energisa in Mato Grosso do Sul. In the Coordination for Large Clients and Public Sector, I focus on developing automations and process improvements using RPA's, along with conducting data analysis to support decision-making. My goal is to integrate my expertise in Computer Science with the specific demands of the energy sector, developing tools that optimize operations and provide strategic insights.

🔧 My primary tools include Python, Power BI, Excel, and SQL, which I use to create solutions that not only add value to the business but also improve operational efficiency.

📚 I am committed to expanding my knowledge in the energy sector and emerging technologies, aiming to specialize at the intersection of Computer Science and Energy.

Let's connect and explore new opportunities for collaboration!
